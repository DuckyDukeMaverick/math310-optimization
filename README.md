## Brief Overview

In MATH310: Optimization, I learn optimization concepts & algorithms such as Gradient Descent, Newton's Method, or Lagrange's Multipliers. More details can be found [here](https://fuvmath.github.io/course-list/#math-310-mathematical-statistics:~:text=MATH%20301%3A%20Optimization).

<ul>
    <li> Opti_Computational Exercises: contains some of the MATLAB that I wrote to implement optimization algorithms (Gradient Descent, backtracking, etc.) for weekly homework assignments;
    <li> Opt_Final-Project_1: implementation of Conjugate Gradient Descent with Weak Wolfe Condition in Python;
    <li> Opt_Final-Project_2: a project that solves Zero-Sum Games with linear programming algorithms (Simplex Algorithm & Dual Interior Point Method)
